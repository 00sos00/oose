### 2.2 Similiar System Information

This system is designed as a **stand-alone** real estate management platform, offering features for property administration and transaction documentation. While it operates independently, it supports integration with third-party services such as cloud storage (Google Drive, AWS) for document management, communication platforms for automated notifications ( Whatsapp ), and relational databases (MySQL) for efficient data storage and retrieval. Unlike standard property management software, this system is designed to fit the company's workflows, making operations more efficient and well-organized.

 <!-- Standard property management software is generic and not customized.
